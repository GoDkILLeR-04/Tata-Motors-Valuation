# DCF Model – Base Case Projection

This model uses the **Base Case** projection method, representing the management’s most likely scenario based on current trends and reasonable assumptions. 

## Key Assumptions

- Moderate revenue growth reflecting historical averages
- Margins and costs in line with recent performance
- Conservative capital expenditure and working capital needs

## How to Use

1. **Open the model:**  
   Open `DCF_Model_Base_Case.xlsx` (or corresponding script).

2. **Input your assumptions:**  
   Update the highlighted cells for revenues, margins, WACC, terminal growth, etc. with values you believe are most realistic.

3. **Review outputs:**  
   The model will display the present value of future cash flows, terminal value, and implied valuations.

## When to Use Base Case

- For balanced, most-likely business planning
- When presenting to management or stakeholders who prefer realistic, consensus-driven scenarios
