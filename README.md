## 🔹 Investment Thesis (Snapshot)

- **Undervaluation:** Base-case DCF implies ~85% upside to current price.  
- **Market Leadership:** #1 in India’s electric passenger vehicle market; strong CV positioning.  
- **Operational Recovery:** Q4 FY25 delivered record profit (₹8,600 cr) and margin expansion.

### 🔻 Key Judgment
JLR margin assumptions are the primary valuation driver. Under conservative margin recovery, valuation upside compresses materially, shifting conviction from high-confidence BUY to risk-adjusted BUY.
