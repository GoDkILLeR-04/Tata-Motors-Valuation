## High-Level Methodology

- **DCF Valuation:**  
  Projects future free cash flows using segment- and scenario-specific inputs, discounts at WACC, and computes terminal value. Sensitivity tables provided.

- **Relative Valuation:**  
  Benchmarks Tata Motors against listed Indian and global automotive peers using FY24/FY25 data, calculates implied share prices via peer multiples, and excludes outlier business models for fairer comparison.

- **SOTP (Integrated in Relative Model):**  
  Values each Tata Motors segment with the most relevant peer group multiple. Sums segment values, subtracts net debt, and provides per-share outputs.
